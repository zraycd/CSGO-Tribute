            <div class="hero-secondary">Welcome to the adrenaline-fueled world of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO), a legendary first-person shooter that has captivated gamers worldwide. Developed by Valve Corporation and Hidden Path Entertainment, CS:GO is the fourth installment in the iconic Counter-Strike series.

                Immerse yourself in intense tactical gameplay where two teams, Terrorists and Counter-Terrorists, face off in a battle of wits and precision. Whether you're navigating the narrow streets of Dust II, strategizing on the rooftops of Mirage, or engaging in close-quarters combat on Nuke, each map offers a unique challenge that demands teamwork, skill, and lightning-fast reflexes.
                
                CS:GO is not just a game; it's a competitive phenomenon that has become a cornerstone of the esports landscape. From nail-biting clutch plays to epic tournament showdowns, the game has produced a rich tapestry of memorable moments that continue to define the esports industry.</div> <br>

            <div class="s2-content">The game pits two teams, Terrorists and Counter-Terrorists, against each other in different objective-based game modes. The most common game mode is explained below.</div>

            <div class="s2-left">
                <div>Counter-Terrorists spawn with a western pistol 'USP-S' and have the option, given they have enough money, to buy better guns, armor, grenades and a defuse kit. Their goal is to defend bomb sites A and B from the terrorists. If the terrorists manage to break through CT's defenses, CT's must retake the site and defuse the bomb before it explodes. If CT's manage to kill all terrorists or defuse the planted bomb, they win the round and are given money.</div>

            <div class="s2-right">
                <div>Terrorists spawn with the pistol 'Glock-18' and just like Counter-Terrorists, are given the option to buy better guns, armor and grenades. One of the 5 players is also given the C4 bomb. Their goal is to plant the bomb and defend it with their team for 40 seconds, after which the bomb detonates and Terrorists win the round. The terrorists are given 110 seconds to plant the bomb, or kill all 5 of the Counter-Terrorists. If they fail to do one of the 2, they lose the round.</div>

        </div>
        <div class="s2-bottom">The game is won by the first team to win 16 rounds and can also be tied when both teams have 15 rounds won. Players can communicate through text or voice chats to discuss their strategy for the next round, which usually leads to complete chaos.</div>
