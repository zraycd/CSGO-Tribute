            <div class="hero-secondary">Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) is a 2012 multiplayer tactical first-person shooter developed by Valve and Hidden Path Entertainment. It is the fourth game in the Counter-Strike series. Developed for over two years, Global Offensive was released for OS X, PlayStation 3, Windows, and Xbox 360 in August 2012, and for Linux in 2014.</div> <br>
            <div class="hero-secondary">Counter-Strike 2, a major update bringing the game to the Source 2 engine, was announced on March 22, 2023, and was released on September 27, 2023. Official matchmaking for Global Offensive was shut down that day, though players were still able to connect to community servers. A legacy version of Global Offensive was later released for outdated devices and platforms unable to run Counter-Strike 2, though matchmaking was still disabled. Additionally, the game remains playable on Xbox 360.</div>

            <div class="s2-content">The game pits two teams, Terrorists and Counter-Terrorists, against each other in different objective-based game modes. The most common game mode is explained below.</div>

        <div class="s2-middle">
            <div class="s2-left">
                <div>Counter-Terrorists spawn with a western pistol 'USP-S' and have the option, given they have enough money, to buy better guns, armor, grenades and a defuse kit. Their goal is to defend bomb sites A and B from the terrorists. If the terrorists manage to break through CT's defenses, CT's must retake the site and defuse the bomb before it explodes. If CT's manage to kill all terrorists or defuse the planted bomb, they win the round and are given money.</div>

            <div class="s2-right">
                <div>Terrorists spawn with the pistol 'Glock-18' and just like Counter-Terrorists, are given the option to buy better guns, armor and grenades. One of the 5 players is also given the C4 bomb. Their goal is to plant the bomb and defend it with their team for 40 seconds, after which the bomb detonates and Terrorists win the round. The terrorists are given 110 seconds to plant the bomb, or kill all 5 of the Counter-Terrorists. If they fail to do one of the 2, they lose the round.</div>

        </div>
        <div class="s2-bottom">The game is won by the first team to win 16 rounds and can also be tied when both teams have 15 rounds won. Players can communicate through text or voice chats to discuss their strategy for the next round, which usually leads to complete chaos.</div>
