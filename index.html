            <div class="hero-secondary">Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) is a 2012 multiplayer tactical first-person shooter developed by Valve and Hidden Path Entertainment. It is the fourth game in the Counter-Strike series. Developed for over two years, Global Offensive was released for OS X, PlayStation 3, Windows, and Xbox 360 in August 2012, and for Linux in 2014.</div> <br>
            <div class="hero-secondary">Counter-Strike 2, a major update bringing the game to the Source 2 engine, was announced on March 22, 2023, and was released on September 27, 2023. Official matchmaking for Global Offensive was shut down that day, though players were still able to connect to community servers. A legacy version of Global Offensive was later released for outdated devices and platforms unable to run Counter-Strike 2, though matchmaking was still disabled. Additionally, the game remains playable on Xbox 360.</div>
